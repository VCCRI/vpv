#There are two types of file in here. 

1. The qt ui xml files, which can be edited in qtdesigner
2. The compiled python qt code files


After editing the .ui files, the corresponding .py file can be generated like so:

	 pyuic5 --from-imports ui_file.ui -o  ui_file.py 

The --from--imports enabled relative import from the reources_rc.py file, which was neeed to package fro PyPi  


pyuic5 can be installed by `apt install pyqt5-dev-tools`
